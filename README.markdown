### Other people put stuff here.
But I'm just gonna keep it as my todo list. Maybe.

# @TODO
### Sizes
Table for storing sizes - figured this would be best to "customize" the drop down lists, also for adding custom sizes to the lists.

### Statistics
*	advertiser
*	campaign
*	advertisement
	*	preview
	*	zones
	*	notes
		* thought up something useful. How about a "Print w/ me" checkbox to show hide the notes field in printouts. That way it can be hidden if the printout/pdf/email (when it's done) will not show up to the client
	*	size
		* dependent on the sizes section - will probably work on next
	*	charts
		* thought it would be fun to put charts in stats view (also practice for when I get onto the dashboard)
	* close/cancel button
	* print button (for the silly users)

### Dashboard
Lots planned for this. Almost too much.

### Module
* re-factor completely and thoroughly test.
* new templates/layouts

### General
* Required Fields
* redirect
	* seems very very broken in Nooku. Doesn't remember where you were last on save/apply/cancel - going to look into it

### Learn Markdown
Probably time.
